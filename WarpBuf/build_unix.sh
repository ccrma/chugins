# The quirky thing about this build script is that on macOS, we can't
# use the libsndfile from brew because it's not a static library.
# Therefore, we build libsndfile statically locally and link against it
# in the CMakeLists.txt. On Windows, we can just download libsndfile
# from its GitHub releases.
