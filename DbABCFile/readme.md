# DbABCFile

## Intro

DbABCFile is a parser for abc files for ChucK.  We combine the
design of the built-in StkMidiFileIn with the abcMIDI toolset
created by James Allwright in the early 1990 and presently maintained 
by Seymour Shlien [found here](https://github.com/sshlien/abcmidi).
Many files in abcmidi claim GPL2 licensing status.  Guess that's
a good thing since this source (and ChucK) is also under that scheme.
